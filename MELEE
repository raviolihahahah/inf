conditioning: there should be balance between feints and not feints
morphs hard to chamber read if opponent is chambering neutrals
morphs to bait chambers (only chambers for neutrals) 
drags to bait chambers
drags lose conditioning . . .. .


dont chamber second attack in enemy combo after getting hit for the first time (attack lockout after getting hit)
chamber when opponent is low stam
combo when disarming
punish combo faster
make smaller drags
