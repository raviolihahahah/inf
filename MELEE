conditioning: there should be balance between feints and not feints
there should be balance between chamber baits and non-baits
morphs hard to chamber read if opponent is chambering neutrals
morphs to bait chambers (only chambers for neutrals) 
drags to bait chambers
drags lose conditioning . . .. .


dont chamber second attack in enemy combo after getting hit for the first time (attack lockout after getting hit)
chamber when opponent is low stam if stam permits and look at hp for trades in 1vX (take in mind your stats) 
combo when disarming
make smaller drags
change to secondary when low stam
